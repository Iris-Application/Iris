 Iris app has been designed as a communication app. It starts with a login page where users should enter their usernames and the channel that they want to join in.<br/>
 It is a real-time app which means multiple users are able to send messages to eachother and view the messages instantly. Users are informed if a user joins the channel or leaves it. Users should enter the same channel name to be able to chat and send messages to one another.
